Static and Dynamic type language:

Statically typed languages performs type checking at compile time whereas dynamically typed languages
performs type checking during runtime. If a script written in a statically typed language contains errors then 
it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed. example: Java, C. But in dynamically typed 
languages type check is done during run time. example: Javascript

Strongly and Weakly type language:

Strongly type language are those in which we have to explicitly specify types of variables and objects. example: C, Java. 
Wheresas in Weakly type language we do not need to specify the type of variables thus provides more flexiblity to the 
code. Example: Javascript, Python.

Compiler and Interpreter:

Compiler is a language processor which converts the High level language into machine level language at once.example: C, C++, Java
Interpreter is also a language processor which converts the High level language into Machine level language but Line byLine. 

Transpiler:
Transpilers or source-to-source compilers are used to convert one programming  language into corresponding another 
programming language.example: Typescript transpiler converts Typescript code to JavaScript.
